# 🧠 Custom Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of two key unsupervised machine learning algorithms: **K-Means** and **DBSCAN**, written in Python with a clean, modular design inspired by `scikit-learn`.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom `KMeans` and `DBSCAN` classes with `.fit()` and `.fit_predict()` methods
- ✅ Support for multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev)
- ✅ Numpy-based optimized computation
- ✅ Fully functional Jupyter Notebook for applying clustering to **image feature data**
- ✅ Visualization of clustering outputs and effect of hyperparameters

## 📁 Files

- `algorithms.py`: Main implementation of the clustering algorithms
- `image_clustering.ipynb`: Demonstration notebook using sample image datasets

## 📊 Example Use Case

The notebook demonstrates how these algorithms behave when applied to image feature vectors, allowing users to explore:
- Cluster assignments
- Label noise handling in DBSCAN
- Initialization sensitivity in K-Means
